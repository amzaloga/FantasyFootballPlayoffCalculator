# FantasyFootballPlayoffCalculator
This is a application that I created for my fantasy football league.

The purpose of this application is to predict the outcome of each matchup to predict what you need to do to get into 
the playoffs.

This is built using java.swing and java.JDBC

I've built the database on my local machine.
